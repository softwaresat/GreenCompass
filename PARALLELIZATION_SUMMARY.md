Your GreenCompass app now has 4-worker submenu parallelization!

## What Changed:

2. Backend has 4-worker pool for submenu processing  
3. Advanced search service uses parallel processing
4. Intelligent fallback to standard processing

## Configuration:
- MAX_WORKERS=4 (configurable)
- ENABLE_PARALLEL_SUBMENUS=true
- ENABLE_CLUSTERING=true

## Monitoring:
