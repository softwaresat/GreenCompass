# �� Parallelization Now Enabled!

Your GreenCompass app now has **submenu parallelization** with 4 workers:

## ✅ What's Been Enabled

1. **Frontend Service Updated** ()
   - Now uses  by default
   - Intelligent fallback to standard endpoint if needed
   - Enhanced logging for parallel processing stats

2. **Backend Worker Pool** ()
   - 4-worker thread pool for submenu processing
   - Parallel distribution of submenu links across workers
   - Configurable via environment variables

3. **Advanced Search Service** ()
   - Updated to use parallel processing for better performance
   - All restaurant analysis now leverages submenu parallelization

## 🚀 Performance Benefits

- **Faster Complex Sites**: Multi-section menus process in parallel
- **Better Resource Usage**: CPU cores utilized efficiently  
- **Scalable Processing**: Handles multiple submenus simultaneously
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Graceful degradation if workers unavailable

## ⚙️ Configuration

Your backend now supports these environment variables:
- `MAX_WORKERS=4` (number of worker threads)
- `ENABLE_PARALLEL_SUBMENUS=true` (enable/disable feature)
- `ENABLE_CLUSTERING=true` (process-level parallelization)

## 📊 Monitoring

Check parallelization status:
- Health: `GET /health` (shows worker pool status)
- Config: `GET /api/config` (detailed parallelization settings)

## 🎯 Usage

The app now automatically:
1. Tries parallel processing first for better performance
2. Falls back to standard processing if needed
3. Logs detailed performance statistics
4. Distributes submenu scraping across 4 workers

Your restaurants with complex, multi-section menus will now process significantly faster!
